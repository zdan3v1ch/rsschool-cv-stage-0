## About me
Hi, my name is Anatoly and I am currently working as a leading engineer at a pharmaceutical company. In my free time I play basketball, study web development and English. I want to work in a large foreign company and see it from the inside. I try to look at things from different angles, analyze the information received and draw conclusions.
